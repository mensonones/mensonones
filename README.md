## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys working close to the metal when needed — from **native Android integrations** to **secure backend logic** — while still delivering polished cross-platform experiences.

My work emphasizes:
- Performance and scalability  
- Mobile and backend security (OWASP-driven mindset)  
- Clean architecture and long-term maintainability  

I actively contribute to **open-source tools and frameworks**, especially in the **React Native and Expo ecosystem**, helping improve real-world developer experience.
